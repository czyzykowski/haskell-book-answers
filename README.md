# Haskell Book Exercise answers

Those are the answers to the exercises in [Haskell Book][book].

I'm doing my best to ensure that all the answers are correct but because I'm
also learning the language at the same time there's a possibility that there
will be some errors. If you find one please create an issue.

## Current list of answers

The list will be updated as I will write down the answers.

1. [Chapter  1](chapter01.md)
1. [Chapter  2](chapter02.md)
